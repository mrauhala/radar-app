| REQ-008 | Visual Theme Selection | As a user, I want to choose between light and dark map themes so that I can optimize visibility for different conditions | Toggle between ArcGIS World Light/Dark Gray base maps with consistent overlay |
| REQ-009 | Radar Opacity Control | As a user, I want to adjust radar transparency so that I can balance radar visibility with map detail | 10-step opacity control from 10% to 100% with visual percentage display |
| REQ-010 | Time Display | As a user, I want to see the current radar frame timestamp so that I know when the displayed data was captured | UTC time and date display updated with each frame showing HH.MM format and DD.MM.YYYY |
| REQ-011 | Progress Indicator | As a user, I want to see animation progress so that I can understand my position in the time sequence | Visual progress bar showing current frame position in animation loop |
| **MOBILE OPTIMIZATION** |

| REQ-013 | Touch Controls | As a mobile user, I want large, easy-to-tap controls so that I can operate the app with my fingers | Minimum 44px touch targets with hover states and visual feedback |
| REQ-014 | PWA Features | As a mobile user, I want to install the app on my home screen so that I can access it like a native app | Progressive Web App capabilities with appropriate meta tags and theme colors |
| **DATA MANAGEMENT** |
| REQ-015 | WMS Data Integration | As a system, I need to fetch radar data from WMS servers so that current weather information is displayed | Support for WMS GetCapabilities and GetMap requests with proper error handling |
| REQ-016 | Time Series Data Handling | As a system, I need to process temporal radar data so that animation sequences can be created | Parse WMS time dimensions and handle both comma-separated and period-based time formats |
| REQ-017 | Progressive Data Loading | As a user, I want the app to start showing data quickly so that I don't wait for all frames to load | Start animation as soon as first frame loads, continue loading remaining frames in background |
| REQ-018 | Image Caching | As a system, I need to cache radar images so that animation playback is smooth | In-memory caching of all radar frames with batched loading (4 concurrent requests) |
| REQ-019 | High-Resolution Images | As a user, I want crisp radar imagery so that I can see detailed precipitation patterns | 4096×4096 pixel SVG images for scalable, high-quality display |
| **PERFORMANCE** |
| REQ-020 | Request Timeout Handling | As a system, I need to handle slow or unresponsive servers so that the app remains functional | 15-second timeout on GetCapabilities, 60-second timeout on image loading |
| REQ-021 | Parallel Frame Loading | As a system, I need to load multiple radar frames efficiently so that users get quick access to data | Batch loading with configurable concurrency limits to avoid server overload |
| REQ-022 | Memory Management | As a system, I need to manage memory usage so that the app performs well on mobile devices | Efficient canvas rendering and image object management |
| **ERROR HANDLING** |
| REQ-023 | Network Error Recovery | As a user, I want clear feedback when data loading fails so that I understand system status | User-friendly error messages with 5-second auto-hide and state recovery |
| REQ-024 | Graceful Degradation | As a user, I want the base map to work even if radar data fails so that I can still use basic map functionality | Base map remains functional when radar overlay fails to load |
| REQ-025 | Server Timeout Management | As a system, I need to handle server timeouts gracefully so that the app doesn't hang indefinitely | Global 5-minute timeout with progressive loading fallback |
| **PERSISTENCE** |
| REQ-026 | User Preference Storage | As a user, I want my settings remembered between sessions so that I don't need to reconfigure each time | LocalStorage persistence for country, theme, opacity, and speed settings |
| REQ-027 | Session State Recovery | As a user, I want the app to restore my last used settings when I return so that I can continue where I left off | Automatic restoration of last country (default: Finland), theme (default: dark), opacity (default: 70%), speed (default: 2×) |
| **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE** |
| REQ-028 | Client-Side JavaScript | As a developer, I want vanilla JavaScript implementation so that the app has minimal dependencies | Pure JavaScript with OpenLayers 10.5.0 as only external dependency |
| REQ-029 | Configurable Data Sources | As an administrator, I want to easily add new radar data sources so that coverage can be expanded | Separated configuration in config.js with clear WMS endpoint definitions |
| REQ-030 | Container Deployment | As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy using containers so that the app can run consistently across environments | Docker support with nginx:alpine base image and Kubernetes deployment manifests |
| REQ-031 | Lightweight Deployment | As a system administrator, I want minimal resource requirements so that the app can run efficiently | Static file serving with 64Mi-128Mi memory limits and 50m-100m CPU limits |
| **SECURITY** |
| REQ-032 | Secure Container Runtime | As a security engineer, I want containers to run with minimal privileges so that security risks are reduced | Non-root execution with limited Linux capabilities (CHOWN, SETUID, SETGID, NET_BIND_SERVICE) |
| REQ-033 | No Privilege Escalation | As a security engineer, I want to prevent privilege escalation so that the app cannot gain additional permissions | Container security context with allowPrivilegeEscalation: false |
| **MONITORING** |
| REQ-034 | Health Check Endpoints | As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor app health so that I can ensure service availability | HTTP health checks on root path (/) for liveness and readiness probes |
| REQ-035 | Loading Progress Feedback | As a user, I want to see loading progress so that I know the app is working | Visual progress bar with frame count display during data loading |
| **EXTENSIBILITY** |
| REQ-036 | Modular Configuration | As a developer, I want to add new countries easily so that radar coverage can be expanded | Clear configuration structure in config.js with displayName, description, and WMS parameters |
| REQ-037 | Customizable Animation Speeds | As a developer, I want to modify animation speeds so that the app can be tuned for different use cases | Configurable speeds array allowing easy adjustment of playback rates |
